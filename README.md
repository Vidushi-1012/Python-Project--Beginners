Beginner-Friendly Python Projects
A collection of 6 simple Python projects I built while learning the basics of programming. These projects helped me practice problem-solving, external libraries, and real-world applications. 🚀

---------------------------------

🔹 1. QR Code Generator
Generates a scannable QR code from text or URL

Uses qrcode and Pillow libraries

Saves output as an image (qrcode.png)
📂 File: qrcode_generator.py
📖 Concepts: External libraries, Image processing

🔹 2. Calculator (CLI)
A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Runs in terminal with user input
📂 File: calculator.py
📖 Concepts: Functions, Conditionals, Loops

🔹 3. To-Do List (Console Version)
Add, remove, and view tasks
Saves tasks in a text file so they persist between runs
📂 File: todo_list.py
📖 Concepts: File handling, Lists, User input

🔹 4. Number Guessing Game 🎮
The computer generates a random number
User keeps guessing until correct
Provides hints: Too high or Too low
📂 File: number_guessing.py
📖 Concepts: Random module, Loops, Conditionals

🔹 5. Password Generator 🔑
Generates strong random passwords
Options for length, symbols, numbers, and letters
📂 File: password_generator.py
📖 Concepts: Randomization, String manipulation

🔹 6. Rock-Paper-Scissors ✊✋✌️
Classic game against the computer
Keeps track of score
Randomly generates computer’s choice
📂 File: rock_paper_scissors.py
📖 Concepts: Random module, Conditionals, Loops

🌱 What I Learned
Writing clean and reusable Python code
Handling user input and files
Using external libraries like qrcode and Pillow
Applying programming logic to build real-world utilities

-----------------

🚀 Future Scope
Convert projects into GUI apps with Tkinter
Deploy some projects as small web apps (Flask/Streamlit)
Add more beginner-friendly mini projects
